# Getting Started With Application Development

## Developing application with Google Cloud

## Best Practices for Application Development
- Implement microservice based architecture with loosely coupled services those can be monitored and fail gracefully on error.
- complaiance with local laws.
- user latency - region to deplloy app
- build and release systems - CICD
- roll back to previous version quickly

### Build for the cloud
- Global Reach
- Scalability and High Availability
- Security


### Code and Environment
- use Code Repository
- use Dependency Management system - define dependencies into a file - Maven, Gradle, NPM etc
- Seperate Configuration Settings and push configs as environment variables

### Perform asynchronous operations
- Keep UI responsive; perform backend operations asynchronously
- Use event-driven processing

### Design for loose coupling
- Publishers and subscribers are loosely coupled
- Consumers of HTTP APIs should bind loosely with publisher payloads

### Implement stateless components for scalability

### Cache content
- cache application data
- cache frontend content

### Implement API gateways to make backend functionality available to consumer applications

### Use federated identity management

### Implement health-check endpoints

### Set up logging and monitor applicatio's performance

### Perform high availability testing and develop disaster recovery plans
